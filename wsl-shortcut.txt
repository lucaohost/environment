Shortcut CTRL + ALT + T to WSL

It's necessary has the file wsl.lnk in the desktop area. 

Tips: It's kinda slow open the WSL terminal everytime, so I keep open the WSL terminal in second desktop area (not the second monitor). When I press the shortcut, Windows redirects me automatically to the WSL Terminal quickly. To paste in WSL terminal use the right click of the mouse and to copy ctrl+insert. 

If doesn't work, do this:

"First, you can create a shortcut for the WSL terminal.

Right-click on an empty area of your desktop and choose 'New' > 'Shortcut'.

In the window that appears, type the following command:

```
wsl.exe
```

Click 'Next' and give a name to the shortcut, for example, 'WSL Terminal'.

Click 'Finish' to create the shortcut.

Now, right-click on the shortcut you created and select 'Properties'.

In the 'Shortcut' tab, click on the 'Shortcut key' field and press Ctrl + Alt + T.

Click 'OK' to save your changes.

Now, whenever you press Ctrl + Alt + T, the WSL terminal will be opened."
